## USACO Attempts
This repository contains my attempts at USACO problems. I am currently working on the Bronze level problems. I will be updating this repository as I complete more problems.

You might be wondering why I'm creating *yet another* USACO repository, but maybe we all have unique solutions, methods, and more. I also want to use this as motivation to keep working on USACO problems.

I'm using the Java programming language, even though C++ is faster, because I'm more comfortable with Java syntax.
